## API access to the data collections
A set of utility scripts to access the data in the collections is in [saraga_utils](https://github.com/MTG/saraga/tree/master/saraga_utils) folder. The scripts use the PyCompMusic API to access the data. Access to the data requires the users to register on [Dunya](https://dunya.compmusic.upf.edu) and obtain an API token that needs to be used for authentication with PyCompMusic API to download audio, metadata and annotations. 

## Examples
A python notebook that explains the API and shows examples of how you can use the utility code provided in this repository is available [Python notebook](https://github.com/MTG/saraga/blob/master/examples/usage_demo.ipynb)

## Tarball of audio and pitch files 
A tarball of audio and pitch annotations that are not available through this repository is available. Please contact us for a link to the tarball.
