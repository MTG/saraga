## API access to the data collections
A set of utility scripts to access the data in the collections is in [saraga_utils](https://github.com/MTG/saraga/tree/master/saraga_utils) folder. The scripts use the PyCompMusic API to access the data. Access to the data requires the users to register on [Dunya](https://dunya.compmusic.upf.edu) and obtain an API token that needs to be used for authentication with PyCompMusic API to download audio, metadata and annotations. 

## Examples
A python notebook that explains the API and shows examples of how you can use the utility code provided in this repository is available [Python notebook](https://github.com/MTG/saraga/blob/master/examples/usage_demo.ipynb)

## Zip archive of audio and pitch files 
In case you don't wish to use the API to access audio and pitch files (they are not available through this repository), we have a zip archive of those files.
